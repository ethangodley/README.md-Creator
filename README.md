## Description
The purpose of this project is to create a README.md file from the command line to allow developers to quickly create a README file
for each project they complete. This is designed to save the user time by allowing user to type in answers to questions without worrying about formatting
and without thinking what needs to be included in the README, as the program prompts the user for each required field. 

## Installation
To correctly install this project git clone the repository to your local computer and run 'npm i' from the command line to install dependancies.

## Usage
To use this project run node index.js in the relevant directory and follow the prompts of your program. Once all questions are answered a README.md file will be created in the current directory. WARNING: This will overwrite any existing file named README.md in the same directory.

## Contributing 
To contribute to this project make desired changes and create a detailed pull request in github for head developer to approve.
